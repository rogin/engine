## Mission Statement

To empower seamless healthcare interoperability through an open, community-driven integration engine that is accessible, extensible, and standards-based.

---

## Overview

The **Open Integration Engine Project** is an open-source initiative committed to advancing healthcare interoperability. Building upon the foundation of **Mirth Connect**, a widely adopted integration engine, this project aims to provide healthcare organizations with a robust, flexible, and cost-effective solution for connecting disparate systems and facilitating efficient data exchange.

---

## Why Open Integration Engine?

- **Open Source Advantage**  
  Transparency, innovation, and collaborative development within the healthcare IT community.

- **Healthcare-Focused**  
  Designed to address the unique challenges of healthcare data integration, supporting standards such as HL7, FHIR, and DICOM.

- **Extensible and Customizable**  
  Modular architecture for customization and expansion to meet evolving needs.

---

## Core Features

- **Data Transformation and Mapping**  
  Convert between HL7, JSON, XML, and other formats to ensure cross-system compatibility.

- **Message Routing and Filtering**  
  Route messages using flexible, rules-based logic to streamline workflows.

- **Custom Scripting and Connectors**  
  JavaScript-based scripting and support for protocols like HTTP/S, FTP, and database connectivity.

- **Real-Time Monitoring and Alerts**  
  Visual tools for tracking message flow, performance metrics, and setting up alerts.

---

## Who It’s For

- **Integration Engineers** – Looking for a flexible, open platform for managing interfaces  
- **Health IT Teams** – Connecting EHRs, LIS, RIS, and other healthcare systems  
- **EHR Vendors** – Enhancing interoperability within their products  
- **Researchers** – Requiring reliable, standards-based integration tools

---

## Building from Source

The build is driven by Gradle through the committed wrapper; the only prerequisite is JDK 17 (see [.sdkmanrc](.sdkmanrc)):

```bash
./gradlew build              # full build + tests; distribution lands in server/setup
./gradlew clean build dist   # release form, plus extension zips in server/dist
```

On Windows use `gradlew.bat`. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full command reference, the dependency policy, and how to run the server for development.

## Project Values

- **Community-Driven Development** – Innovation through global collaboration  
- **Vendor Neutrality** – Free from proprietary constraints  
- **Security and Compliance** – HIPAA/GDPR-compliant architecture
